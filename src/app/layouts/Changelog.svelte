                Happy Tanabeta 2.1, everyone. The major new features to test out are as follows. <br>

            <p style="width: 70%; margin: auto; text-align: left; line-height: 1.6">
                • The new Reference Panel. Accessible from the File tab, this panel allows you to view a second file in read-only mode. <br>
                • Advanced Settings: Alternate Orthographies. This option gives you access to the Orthography tab, where you can designate alternative
                orthographies and fonts installed on your system. <br>

                the new and old words, and opens the old file in the Reference Panel.
